# Google-DA-Capstone
This is the capstone project for google data analytics certificate. It illustrates the completion of a 8 month intensive data analytics certification (provided by Google) and implementation of all the skills to this capstone case-study included in the certification.

This project involves a data analysis case-study for a fictional, bike-sharing company named “Cyclistic” to answer the key business questions by following the steps of a standard data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

## Scenario
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 

By drawing insights into how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently, a decision will have to be made to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

To do that an understanding will be required on **How do annual members and casual riders differ?**
