# Cyclistic trip data analysis(R&SQL)

This document, generated using an rmd file, demonstrates the problem, process, codes and visualizations for the complete analysis of the cyclistic trip data.


```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
